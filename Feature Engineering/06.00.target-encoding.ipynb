The technique we'll look at in this lesson, *target encoding*, is instead meant for categorical features. It's a method of encoding categories as numbers, like one-hot or label encoding, with the difference that it also uses the *target* to create the encoding. This makes it what we call a **supervised** feature engineering technique.\n","\n","*Повечето от техниките, които видяхме в този курс, бяха за числени характеристики. Техниката, която ще разгледаме в този урок, **целово кодиране**, вместо това е предназначена за категорични характеристики. Това е метод за кодиране на категории като числа, като `one-hot` или `label encoding`, с тази разлика, че използва и **target** за създаване на кодиране. Това го прави това, което ние наричаме техника за инженеринг на **наблюдавани/управлявани** характеристики.*"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-16T09:54:06.219383Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-16T09:54:06.218859Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-16T09:54:06.293263Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-16T09:54:06.292183Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-16T09:54:06.219344Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style

Applied to a binary target, it's also called **bin counting**. (Other names you might come across include: likelihood encoding, impact encoding, and leave-one-out encoding.)\n","\n","# Smoothing #\n","\n","An encoding like this presents a couple of problems, however. First are *unknown categories*. Target encodings create a special risk of overfitting, which means they need to be trained on an independent \"encoding\" split. When you join the encoding to future splits, Pandas will fill in missing values for any categories not present in the encoding split. These missing values you would have to impute somehow.\n","\n","*Кодиране като това обаче създава няколко проблема. **Първо** са *\"неизвестните категории\"*. Целевите \n","кодировки създават специален риск от пренастройване(**overfitting**), което означава, че те трябва да \n","бъдат обучени на независим сплит(подмножество) за \"кодиране\". Когато присъедините кодирането към бъдещи \n","разделяния, Pandas ще попълни липсващите стойности за всички категории, които не присъстват в сплит за \n","кодиране. Тези липсващи стойности ще трябва да запълните по някакъв начин.*\n","\n","**Second** are *rare categories*. When a category only occurs a few times in the dataset, any statistics \n","calculated on its group are unlikely to be very accurate. In the *Automobiles* dataset, the `mercurcy` \n","make only occurs once. The \"mean\" price we calculated is just the price of that one vehicle, which might \n","not be very representative of any Mercuries we might see in the future. Target encoding rare categories \n","can make overfitting more likely.\n","\n","*__Второ__ са *\"редките категории\"*. Когато дадена категория се среща само няколко пъти в набора от данни, \n","всяка статистика, изчислена за нейната група, е малко вероятно да бъде много точна. В набора от данни \n","*Automobiles* марката `mercurcy` се среща само веднъж. „Средната“ цена, която изчислихме, е само цената на \n","това едно превозно средство, което може да не е много представително за \"mercurcy\", който може да видим в \n","бъдеще. Целевото кодиране на редки категории може да направи пренастройването по-вероятно.*\n","\n","A solution to these problems is to add **smoothing**. The idea is to blend the *in-category* average with \n","the *overall* average. Rare categories get less weight on their category average, while missing categories \n","just get the overall average.\n","\n","*Решение на тези проблеми е добавянето на **изглаждане**. Идеята е да се смеси средната \"в категорията\" с \n","\"общата\" средна стойност. Редките категории получават по-малка тежест от средната за категорията си, \n","докато липсващите категории получават само общата средна стойност.*\n","In pseudocode:\n","```\n","encoding = weight * in_category + (1 - weight) * overall\n","```\n","where `weight` is a value between 0 and 1 calculated from the category frequency.\n","\n","An easy way to determine the value for `weight` is to compute an **m-estimate**:\n","```\n","weight = n / (n + m)\n","```\n","where `n` is the total number of times that category occurs in the data. The parameter `m` determines the \"smoothing factor\". Larger values of `m` put more weight on the overall estimate.\n","\n","<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n","<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/1uVtQEz.png\" width=500, alt=\"\">\n","<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center>\n","</center></figcaption>\n","</figure>\n","\n","In the *Automobiles* dataset there are three cars with the make `chevrolet`.

Does the price of a vehicle vary a great deal within each make? Would you need a lot of data to get good estimates? If so, it could be better to choose a larger value for `m`; if the average price for each make were relatively stable, a smaller value could be okay.\n","\n","*Когато избирате стойност за „m“, помислете колко разнородни очаквате да бъдат категориите. Цената на \n","автомобила варира ли много в рамките на всяка марка? Имате ли нужда от много данни, за да получите добри \n","оценки?
